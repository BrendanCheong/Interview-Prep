# Insert Interval

This question requires you to consider like 4 cases, 2 of which are edge cases lol.

Edge case:
1. the interval should be at the end of the list, since the START and END is greater than all
2. the interval should be at the start of the list, since the START and END is smaller than all
3. the interval is in between other intervals
4. the interval merges with 1 or more intervals
